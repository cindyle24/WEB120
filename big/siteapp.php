According to the ThinkMobiles Blog, in theory, a responsive or mobile website is 
just like any other as it uses HTML pages that can be accessed with any web browser. 
However, a usual website is built for viewing on a desktop, whereas, a mobile app is 
specially designed to appear on smaller screens for mobile devices such as phones and 
tablets. When it comes to responsive websites compared to mobile apps, they involve 
similar skill sets with building desktop websites, whereas mobile apps require 
a different skill set. They each have their pros and cons since they’re both different.

For mobile responsive websites, they’re available for all users since it 
doesn’t require any downloading or installing. Majority of the time these 
sites are free as well. They’re easy to build, support, and update. The 
cost of maintaining a responsive website is low as well.

Mobile apps are developed for different operating systems like iOS and Android. 
Mobile apps need to be installed separately but works well offline. As ThinkMobiles 
stated, while responsive mobile sites are for potential new customers, native apps 
are for your regular clients.

When it comes to the cons of responsive websites, Kris from Smashstack 
says that while they’re necessary in today’s business climate, it’s not 
as fast or as functional as native mobile apps. But that doesn’t make 
mobile apps free of cons since they require lots of time and money to build.

<p>
With the ever increasing number of mobile users, a business needs a
 mobile connection to branch out. If you were part of a big business 
 like a bank, a chain restaurant, or a social media app, then mobile 
 apps are needed for brand recognition. However, if you’re a small 
 business with a limited budget a mobile responsive site could suffice. 
 At the end of the day, it comes down to time, cost, and business goals.
